# Water Quality Prediction for Aquaculture

This project predicts water quality parameters using a Voting Ensemble model deployed on Azure Machine Learning Studio.

## Features
- Real-time prediction via REST API
- Built with Azure ML Studio and Python
- Uses public dataset from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y78ty2g293/1)

## Steps
1. Prepare dataset and upload to Azure ML Studio
2. Train Voting Ensemble model
3. Deploy model as real-time endpoint
4. Use Python script to send prediction requests

## Setup
- Store API key and endpoint in `.env` file
- Run `inference_script.py` to test predictions
